            An email asking you to "confirm your social security number" or "provide your password" in a form.✍️
            <br><br><b>Key:</b>If you are asked to fill a form by giving your password, it means they are bad guys. Your email is known publicly, all they need is your password, so they use forms to easily get passwords. Never❌ fill a form by giving out your password.✍️

            <br><br><b>Key:</b> Whenever you receive an email from an organisation or unknown address, and you are greeted in a general manner, please do not respond or download any attachment from that email, in most cases they are bad guys. ❌❌❌

            <br><br>Such emails can be found in the *spam* section instead of the <b>inbox</b>, yet some can also be found in the <b>inbox</b> section. 

            Only respond or download attachments from such if you are 110% sure that they are safe.✍️
