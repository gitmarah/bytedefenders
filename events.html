                    ByteDefenders had a successful meeting with Mr. Ibrahim Kalokoh, the HOD of the Computer Science department at Unimak. He congratulated us on our efforts and motivated us to continue the good work.
                    He further assured us of his support in our endeavors to achieve our goals. He applauded Mr. Daniel S. Samura, a lecturer at Unimak and the head of Ubuntu, a tech company in Makeni, for nurturing students to undertake and develop new ideas.
                    In his statement, he said that they are working tirelessly to elevate the department to greater heights. He highlighted their struggles and how they reached their current position. In his words, "Sabi watin yu dae do en most importantly humble yu sef (Know what you are doing and most importantly be humble)".
